My favourite of the franchise. A very different vibe to [[Zombieland]]. It IS a re-watch, I watched it in the cinema when it came out. [^1]

I love that it doesn’t do the whole “remember this?” sequel thing. And while there are obviously some jump scares, the tension comes from momentum and choices.

Standard for the genre is the question of what happens when surviving is the only option and what are the morals of this type of world. Here, Spike is dedicated to his Mum. This is the emotional spine.  Dr Kelson, the plot engine, is a kind gentleman who still cares for People™  

[^1]: Re-watchability is one of my favorite personal movie metrics
