Gilroy spared nothing. No fat.

There are no flashy scenes or high-budget fluff, the story unfolds with Michael (Clooney) telling you what’s going on with his face. I’ve not seen many Clooney films aside from the Oceans series, Batman and Up in the Air. After watching his performance, I want to see more.

The film has no mystery or case to solve (it’s all obvious and plainly stated) but it doesn’t detract from the ending. Both my wife and I particularly liked how even though he was divorced, there was no drama surrounding it. This often distracts in other films. We don’t know exactly how family life was, but we also don’t care. Most films would mine that for 20 minutes. This doesn’t bother.

Would rewatch (my signal for great movies is rewatchability)
