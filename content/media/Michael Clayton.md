A film in one of my favorite genres (legal thriller) with absolutely no fat. 

There’s no flashy scenes or high-budget fluff, the story unfolds with Michael (Clooney) pretty much telling you what’s going on with his face.

Both my wife and I particularly liked how even though he was divorced, there was no drama surrounding how bad his family life was, as is so common with many films. This often seems like a distraction. We don’t know exactly how family life was, but we also don’t (didn’t) care.
