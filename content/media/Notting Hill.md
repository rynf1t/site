A classic rom-com that seemingly never gets old. The humour is quintessentially British, with Spike easily being the most hilarious [and absurd] character. I rate this so highly given its re-watchability for me. Not much else to say other than a fun, light-hearted 90’s classic that stands the test of time.

It’s interesting to ponder that back in the late 90’s, there were no camera phones. And, so the paparazzi in this film are the “professional” press. As such, scenes where Anna (Julia Roberts) is causally out for dinner seem plausible in a way that would be impossible in a smartphone era.  We live in a world where the paparazzi is _everyone_. Interesting also to see no one, at all, glaring at a screen during their daily life.
