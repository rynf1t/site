A classic rom-com that seemingly never gets old. The humour is quintessentially British, with Spike easily being the most hilarious [and absurd] character. I rate this so highly given its re-watchability for me. Not much else to say other than its a fun, light-hearted 90’s classic that stands the test of time.

It’s interesting to ponder that back in the late 90’s, there were no camera phones - so the paparazzi in this film are the “professional” press. As such, scenes where Anna (Julia Roberts) is casually out for dinner seem plausible in a way that would be impossible in a smartphone era.  We live in a world where the paparazzi is _everyone_. Interesting also to see no one, at all, glaring at a screen during their daily life.
