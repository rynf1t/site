This film was much funnier in 2009 than it is 17 years later (where does time go!?). A very different vibe to [[28 Years Later]].  ￼


In saying that, it moves very fast, goes for 1.5hours like all good comedies and doesn’t overthink itself 

However, the humour very “late-2000s”. Watching it now feels like it’s performing for an audience that no longer exists. And, the audience it did exist for when it came out [me] now has a different palette.  

It’s not bad, it’s not good. I smiled more than I laughed. Probably not a rewatch as there are other low-stakes and funnier comedies to fit the bill.
