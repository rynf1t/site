description: Useful tools I've built
---
I build tools to solve problems I actually have. Most are small utilities I use regularly. Some solve one specific annoyance and never get touched again. Either way, they exist because I needed them.

  I build these with LLMs - partly because it's faster, partly to understand where AI-assisted development works well and where it breaks down.

  All source code is available. Click [code] to view. Each tool is self-contained and can be copied directly into your own projects.
