description: Useful tools I've built

Below is a list of useful [small] tools I've created, almost all with the assistance of LLMs.

1. I want these tools, be it regularly or only a handful of times
2. Using LLMs this way helps me understand how to use them beyond standard chat interfaces and their constraints, i.e. where they fall short. 

The source code for each can be viewed by clicking [code]. While my site is a monorepo, the files linked should stand on it's own in most cases and can be exported and used immediately.
