# A Dad's High-Yield Training Program: 2 Days Per Week

When you're a dad with limited time and sleep, your training needs to be ruthlessly efficient. No junk volume. No wasted reps. Every minute in the gym needs to count.

This is the program I ran when I only had two 60-minute sessions per week. It's built on principles that matter when time is your scarcest resource.

## The Philosophy: Effective Reps Only

There's growing literature on **effective reps**—the idea that only hard reps count. Specifically, the last 5 reps before hitting failure are what drive adaptation. Everything else? Mostly just fatigue accumulation.

With only 60 minutes and 2 days per week, there's no room for junk volume. Every set needs to be pushed hard.

## Program Structure

I split the sessions into push-bias and pull-bias days rather than strict push/pull splits. This reduces overall systemic fatigue—critical when you're sleep-deprived and pushing intensity hard.

**Important note**: This is NOT a powerlifting program. I'm not prioritizing bench press, deadlifts, or squats. Those movements demand technical precision and sufficient recovery time that I simply don't have in this phase. This is about maintenance and general strength.

All exercises are performed at **0-1 reps in reserve (RIR)**. You can substitute exercises based on your equipment, but be careful with rest-pause and myo-reps on movements requiring high stability.

### Session 1: Push Bias

- **DB Bench Press**: 3 sets × 6-10 reps, 3 min rest
  *Antagonist pairing*: Between sets, alternate with 2 sets of **Pull-ups** × 8-10 reps

- **DB Split Squat**: 3-4 sets × 6-10 reps

- **DB Chest Fly**: 1 myo-rep set at 10-12 reps + mini-sets to failure

- **DB Skull Crushers**: 1 myo-rep set at 10-12 reps + mini-sets

- **DB Lateral Raises**: 1 myo-rep set at 10-12 reps + mini-sets

- **DB Incline Curls**: 1 myo-rep set at 10-12 reps + mini-sets

### Session 2: Pull Bias

- **DB Braced Row**: 3 sets × 6-10 reps, 3 min rest
  *Antagonist pairing*: Between sets, alternate with 2 sets of **Incline DB Press** × 8-10 reps

- **Pull-up / Lat Pulldown**: 2 sets × 10-12 reps

- **DB Romanian Deadlift**: 3-4 sets × 6-10 reps

- **DB Skull Crushers**: 1 myo-rep set at 10-12 reps + mini-sets

- **DB Lateral Raises**: 1 myo-rep set at 10-12 reps + mini-sets

- **DB Incline Curls**: 1 myo-rep set at 10-12 reps + mini-sets

## Key Principles

### 1. Everything Is a Tradeoff

It's hard to get everything in on two sessions. I don't go hard on lower body here because I'm only after maintenance during this period. If you can squeeze in a 3rd day—even a short one—you can accomplish significantly more.

### 2. Scheduling Flexibility

I typically trained Monday and Thursday, but that often changed. As long as I had 2-4 days between sessions, I didn't stress about it.

An alternative approach: Create slightly longer A and B sessions and "just go when you can." Life with kids doesn't follow a rigid schedule.

### 3. The Maintenance Rule

Here's what keeps me training even during the hardest weeks: **You can maintain on 1/3 of the volume and frequency it took to build.**

I typically train at 10-12 sets per muscle group twice per week. This means I can maintain that muscle with just 1 session per week at 5-6 sets. During dieting phases or particularly demanding life periods, this is THE WAY to stay fresh and strong.

This knowledge is incredibly liberating. Even one workout per week is infinitely better than zero.

### 4. Intensity Is Your Only Lever

In a low-volume routine, you have two primary levers: total volume and intensity of effort. When volume is constrained, intensity becomes everything.

Practically, this means:
- **0-2 reps in reserve** on every set
- Maximum focus and intention
- Relentless pursuit of progressive overload (even +1 rep is a win)

These are tried and true principles, but they become non-negotiable when volume is low.

### 5. Rest-Pause and Myo-Reps for Time Efficiency

To save time while maintaining high intensity, I use rest-pause and myo-rep techniques extensively.

**How it works**: You reach your fatigue threshold on the first set, then take short 10-15 second breaks and continue with mini-sets until you can't complete the target reps.

I'd do full rest-pause sessions on most isolation work because of their advantages with low total volume. But be warned: done properly, these are extremely physiologically and psychologically taxing. In an ideal world, I'd use machines for these (better stability when truly pushing to failure), but they're rarely done properly in commercial gyms anyway.

### 6. The Home Gym Setup

I have a set of adjustable dumbbells (up to 32kg) and an adjustable bench in my studio. Add a pull-up bar, and I can do everything in this program.

No commute. No waiting for equipment. No excuses.

## Now: 3 Days Per Week

I've since expanded to 3 days at 45-50 minutes each. The additional session makes a massive difference in what I can fit in, particularly for more direct lower body work.

But if life gets chaotic again? I know I can drop back to this 2-day framework and maintain everything that matters.

## The Takeaway

Perfect is the enemy of done. Two hard sessions per week, executed with maximum intent, will maintain your strength and muscle mass through even the most demanding periods of life.

The key is knowing that maintenance requires far less than building. Once you internalize that, you never have an excuse to stop training entirely.

Even one day per week is enough. But two? Two days gives you real options.
