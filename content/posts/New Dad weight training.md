# Dad Training: 2 Days Per Week

When my daughter was born I had two 60-minute windows per week to train [^1]. That was it.

This program kept me strong through the broken sleep and routine. Here’s what actually worked.

## The Logic

Only the last 5 reps before failure drive adaptation[^2]. Everything else accumulates fatigue. With 120 minutes per week, I couldn’t afford sets that didn’t count.

Every set went to 0-1 reps from failure. Add more volume if you won’t push that hard. The corollary and trade-off is that more volume = more time in the gym.

## The Split

Push-bias and pull-bias full-body. The bias was to limit too much systemic fatigue when you’re already wrecked. I wasn’t (and don’t) training for powerlifting meets. Bench, squat, and deadlift need technical precision and warm-up time I didn’t have. This was maintenance plus whatever more I could eke out.

Swap exercises based on your gear. Just watch rest-pause and myo-reps on anything requiring stability. You’re going to actual failure and form breaks down.

### Session 1: Push Bias

|Exercise         |Sets × Reps  |Rest   |Notes                               |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|------------------------------------|
|DB Bench Press   |3 × 6-10     |3 min  |Superset with pull-ups              |
|Pull-ups         |2 × 8-10     |—      |Between bench sets                  |
|DB Split Squat   |3-4 × 6-10   |2-3 min|                                    |
|DB Chest Fly     |1 myo-rep set|—      |10-12 reps then mini-sets to failure|
|DB Skull Crushers|1 myo-rep set|—      |10-12 reps then mini-sets to failure|
|DB Lateral Raises|1 myo-rep set|—      |10-12 reps then mini-sets to failure|
|DB Incline Curls |1 myo-rep set|—      |10-12 reps then mini-sets to failure|

### Session 2: Pull Bias

|Exercise              |Sets × Reps  |Rest   |Notes                               |
|----------------------|-------------|-------|------------------------------------|
|DB Braced Row         |3 × 6-10     |3 min  |Superset with incline press         |
|Incline DB Press      |2 × 8-10     |—      |Between row sets                    |
|Pull-up / Lat Pulldown|2 × 10-12    |2-3 min|                                    |
|DB Romanian Deadlift  |3-4 × 6-10   |2-3 min|                                    |
|DB Skull Crushers     |1 myo-rep set|—      |10-12 reps then mini-sets to failure|
|DB Lateral Raises     |1 myo-rep set|—      |10-12 reps then mini-sets to failure|
|DB Incline Curls      |1 myo-rep set|—      |10-12 reps then mini-sets to failure|

## What Mattered

Lower body got straight maintenance work only. You could do more if you wanted. Everything’s a tradeoff, pick your character. For me, this held the line.

I aimed for Monday and Thursday but often missed. Life with kids doesn’t follow schedules in the early days. As long as I got 2-4 days between a session, it worked.

You can maintain on a third of the volume it took to build. Before this period I was hitting each muscle group twice per week for a total of 9-12 sets (excluding overlap). That means 4-6 sets once per week holds everything. When dieting or when life’s particularly tough, one [focused and hard] session per week beats zero by infinity. In the span of 10 days, I was hitting everything at least three times. It’s more than it seems on paper.

With low volume, intensity isn’t optional if you want a half-decent benefit and/or results. You need to train hard. That means, 0-2 reps from failure every set. Chase progression obsessively. Track workouts and try to beat the log-book, even +1 rep counts. No volume to hide behind.

Rest-pause and myo-reps saved me loads of time. First set hard, truly hard. Then, 10-15 second breaks, with mini-sets of 3-4 until I couldn’t hit reps anymore. This is auto-regulatory in a way, some days you’ll get 5 mini sets, others only 1-2. Listen to your body. I used this on all isolation movements. [^3]

A home gym of sorts removed friction. Pull-up bar was the only thing I needed a gym for. Everything else I could do with an adjustable bench and adjustable dumbbells. I would substitute pull-ups for DB lat pullovers if I couldn’t make it to the gym.

## Now: 3 Days

I’ve expanded to three 45-50 minute sessions. The extra day makes a big difference for legs. But if things get chaotic again (another kid, for example) I’ll drop back to this framework and maintain what matters.

Two hard sessions per week held my strength and some. Maintenance costs way less than building. Once you know that, you’ve got no excuse to stop entirely.

One day’s enough. Two days gives you options.

[^1]: Sometimes 3, but I wanted to create something that was sound for 2 days of training.
